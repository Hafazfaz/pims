# PIMS Usage Guide: Mastering Personnel & File Management

Welcome to the **Personnel Information Management System (PIMS)**. This guide outlines the core workflows for Registry staff, Management, and General Personnel.

## 1. Digital Signature Management
*For HODs, Unit Managers, and Registry Staff*

Before you can sign official minutes or signals, you must upload your digital signature certificate.

1.  **Access Profile**: Click on your name in the bottom-left sidebar or go to **My Profile**.
2.  **Upload Signature**: In the "Digital Signature" section, upload a clear image of your signature (PNG/JPG).
3.  **Verification**: Once uploaded, your signature is active. In a real-world scenario, the Registry might need to verify this before use.
4.  **Security**: PIMS automatically applies a "Digitally Verified" overlay to your signature on all documents to prevent unauthorized downloading or reuse.

## 2. File Lifecycle Workflows
*For Registry and Management*

### Creating Personal Records
*   **Registry Hub**: Registry users can go to the **Hub** and click **Create File**.
*   **Staff Profiles**: Alternatively, go to **Staff Without Files**, find a staff member, and click **Create File**. This auto-fills their details.

### Activating Files
1.  **Request Activation**: If a file is "Inactive", the owner can click **Request Activation**.
2.  **Approve/Activate**: Registry users will see these requests in their **Dashboard**. Approving the request moves the file to **Active** status.

## 3. The Chronicle: Adding Minutes & Signing
*For all Staff*

The **Chronicle** is the living history of a file.

1.  **Add Document**: Click **Add Minute/Document** on any active file.
2.  **Content**: Enter your minute content or upload an attachment.
3.  **Digital Signature**: If you are authorized, check **Attach Digital Signature**. A live preview of your certificate will appear.
4.  **Security**: Once submitted, your signature is permanently linked to that specific document version.

## 4. Dispatching & Movement (Sending Files)
*For Management and Custodians*

PIMS tracks physical folder movement through digital "Dispatches."

1.  **Send File**: On the File Detail page, use the **Dispatch File** sidebar.
2.  **Select Recipient**: Search for the recipient by name or designation.
3.  **Link Document**: (Optional) Select a specific minute that triggered this movement.
4.  **Track Location**: The file will disappear from your **Inbox** and appear in the recipient's **Inbox**. Registry can track this via the **Outgoing Files** list.

---

## 5. Security & Access Control
*For All Staff*

### Time-Limited Access
If you don't have direct access to a file (e.g., it belongs to another department), you can request temporary access.

1.  **Request Access**: Click **Request Access** on the restricted file page.
2.  **Duration**: Registry can approve this for a specific duration (default: 48 hours).
3.  **Expiry**: After the time limit (or if you log out), access is automatically revoked unless renewed.

---

## 6. Dashboards & Analytics

*   **Registry Dashboard**: Global view of all files, activity velocity, and pending approvals.
*   **Executive Dashboard**: Metrics scoped to a Department or Unit. Shows "Overdue" files that have been in custody for too long.
*   **My Files**: Your personal workspace for files you own or created.
*   **Inbox (Messages)**: Central hub for all files currently in your physical/digital custody.
